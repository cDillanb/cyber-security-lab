data breach on facebook:
in 2019 530 million facebook users information was exposed
on the public internet including phone numbers, facebook IDs,
and account names. In 2021 the data was posted for free, showing
that there was criminal intent surrounding the data.

they have overall increased security, I cant find specifics.
